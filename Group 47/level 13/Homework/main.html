                    Edjirannāzu)</em></mark> is a cyberpunk original net animation (ONA) miniseries based on the video
            game Cyberpunk 2077 by Polish studio CD Projekt Red. The series was animated by Japanese animation studio
            <strong>Trigger</strong> under the supervision of CD Projekt and premiered on Netflix in <b>September
                2022</b>. Set in the Cyberpunk universe created by Mike Pondsmith, the anime serves as a prequel to the
            game and takes place about a year before the events of Cyberpunk 2077. Upon its release, Cyberpunk:
            Edgerunners received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its characters, animation, and worldbuilding.
            <b>In October 2022</b>, CD Projekt had initially announced that the anime would not be receiving a second
            season and stated that, while they were open to collaborating with Trigger for future projects,
            <b>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</b> had always been planned as a standalone work. However, <b>in September
                2024</b>, Netflix had announced a teaser regarding a collaboration between Netflix Animation, CD
            Projekt, and Cyberpunk 2077, stating a <b>"return to Night City."</b>

        <h3>This is one of the most powerful skills to know in Cyberpunk Edgerunners called <b>"Sendevistan"</b></h3>
        <p><b>"Sendevistan"</b> works as such. When somebody uses Sendevistan they are able to move much faster than
            normal, dodge physical attacks, bullets or mostly any type of attack, it makes everything else other than
            user slow. So to pretty much sum it up it makes time slower for you. You could say that it's like a flash
            superpower that makes him very fast but it's still a dfferent thing</p>
