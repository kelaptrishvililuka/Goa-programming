        <h1>Cyberpunk Edgerunners Plot and Setting</h1>
        <p>In a dystopia overrun by corruption, crime, and cybernetic implants, an impulsive but talented street kid
            named David Martinez, after losing everything he has in a drive-by shooting, chooses to survive on the wrong
            side of the law as an "edgerunner": a high-tech, black-market mercenary also known as a "cyberpunk".</p>
        <p>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is set in Night City, a self-reliant metropolis located in the Free State of
            California that suffers from extensive corruption, cybernetic addiction, and gang violence. The city is
            split into six districts, each of which has its own precise living requirements, and is controlled by
            several megacorporations, including Arasaka and its rival Militech. The anime's story is primarily set in
            Santo Domingo, the oldest, poorest, and most industrial district of Night City, and takes place in 2076.</p>
