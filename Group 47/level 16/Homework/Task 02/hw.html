            <h2>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
            <p>Before filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting
                (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so
                chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington. They were
                also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly. After the shoot, the nine cast members playing
                the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John
                Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead. The film is noted for having an ensemble
                cast, and some of the cast and their respective characters include:

                Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: A young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was
                the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999. Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition
                dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel. Wood was selected from 150 actors who
                auditioned. Jake Gyllenhaal unsuccessfully auditioned for the role after his agency miscommunicated
                his direction to an American accent.
                Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for
                the role, but did not understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the
                script. Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.
                Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role. Richard Harris expressed
                interest in the part. John Astin auditioned for Gandalf. Sam Neill was also offered the role but
                declined due to his scheduling conflict with Jurassic Park III. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort
                his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men. He enjoyed playing
                Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films, and based his accent on
                Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the
                Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.
                Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn: A Dúnedain ranger and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered
                the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down. Nicolas Cage also received an offer
                but declined because of family obligations. Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being
                replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young. Russell Crowe was considered as a
                replacement, but he turned it down because he does not want to be typecast and believed to be a similar
                role in Gladiator. Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.
                Executive producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced
                him to take the role. Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing
                from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop. Mortensen became a hit with the crew
                by patching up his costume and carrying his "hero" sword around with him off-camera.
                Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who
                had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored
                Sam's relationship with Frodo. Before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.
                Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor.
                Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script,
                but passed.
                Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin
                of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.
                Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was
                cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.
                John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out
                from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed Dáin II
                Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy. Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play
                Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.Rhys-Davies also
                played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.
                Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially
                auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.
                Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after
                seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having
                one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.
                Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to
                be cast, on 25 August 1999.
                Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy
                Lawless was considered for the role.
                Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will
                through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also
                met J. R. R. Tolkien. He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.
                Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell and Arwen's father who leads the Council of Elrond,
                which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson
                stated, "To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.
                Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell.
                Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings, and was cast as Bilbo
                after Jackson remembered his performance. Sylvester McCoy, who later played Radagast the Brown in The
                Hobbit, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months
                before Jackson went with Holm.
                Andy Serkis as Gollum (voice/motion-capture): A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by
                the Ring after bearing it for 500 years. This character appears briefly in the prologue. In Mordor, one
                can only hear his voice shouting and in Moria, only his eyes and his nose appear. Serkis was working on
                the 1999 six-episode Oliver Twist miniseries when his agent told him that Jackson wanted to approach him
                to play Gollum. Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the
                part as one of his Oliver Twist fellow actors opined that it was not a good idea if his face was not
                going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture
                performance as they wished.. The future of civilization rests on the fate of a single ring that has been
                lost for centuries. Powerful forces are relentless in their pursuit. But fate leaves it in the hands of
                a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the ring and becomes a legend. A
                difficult task awaits Frodo when he becomes the bearer of the ring - to destroy the one ring on Mount
                Doom where it was forged.</p>
