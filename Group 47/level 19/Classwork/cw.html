                <p>Development began in 2004 but did not gain traction until Man of Steel was released in 2013. In
                    August 2014, Beall and Kurt Johnstad were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as
                    director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay. The main
                    cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. Principal photography began in Australia in May
                    2017, taking place at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, with
                    additional production teams in Canada, Italy, and Morocco. Filming concluded the following October.
                    Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging from high-detail hair simulations to the creation
                    of CGI animals and locations.</p>
