                        Riot was one of five Symbiotes forcibly spawned from Venom by the Life Foundation to be used as
                        guards/enforcers for them and their clients.The sinister Life Foundation was an organization
                        that sought to provide a comfortable life for their wealthy clients in the case of a M.A.D.
                        (Mutually Assured Destruction) fallout of the Cold War or in the event of world chaos. Needing a
                        superhuman police force to protect this Utopian future, the Foundation's leader Carlton Drake
                        saw the potential to create these future guardians in the unborn offspring of Venom and had him
                        captured.Once the Foundation captured Venom, who was in San Francisco at the time, they brought
                        him to their lab in Mojave Desert California. There they used a procedure to forcibly extract
                        five Symbiotes “seeds” from Venom and hatched them in a lab. Too young to control a host, the
                        blue-colored infant Symbiote was merged with Trevor Cole, a security force officer of the Life
                        Foundation that was comprised of cops, soldiers, and mercenaries. Together, the symbiotes and
                        Cole became known as Riot, and they, along with the other four symbiotes, would become the
                        Foundations guardian symbiotes.</em></p>

        <p class="p2">Once at the Life Foundation Headquarters, Riot approached Carlton Drake as Suzy. Drake asked Suzy
            if she was lost, to which she replied she wasn't and possessed Carlton, asking for his help in bringing more
            of its kind to Earth, something to which Carlton agreed as it corresponded with his own desire to harvest
            more symbiotes from the comet. After Roland Treece kidnapped Eddie Brock and took him into the Life
            Foundation's facility, Carlton arrived and told him and his mercenaries to get out.Drake asked where Venom
            was but Eddie responded that he didn't know and even if he knew he wouldn't tell him. Drake then changed
            into Riot in order to intimidate him but couldn't get any answers and finally asked Treece to execute him in
            the woods. Later Carlton had a talk with Riot, apologizing for the loss of the other symbiotes, but Riot
            said it didn't matter as they planned to launch another space shuttle in order to recover more symbiotes
            from the comet.</p>
