    <p>Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. (Italian: [ˈalfa roˈmɛːo]) is an Italian carmaker known for its sports-oriented
        vehicles, strong auto racing heritage, and iconic design.[3] Headquartered in Turin, Italy, it is a subsidiary
        of Stellantis Europe and one of 14 brands of multinational automotive company Stellantis.

        Founded on 24 June 1910 in Milan, Italy as A.L.F.A.—an acronym for Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili[a]—the
        company was established by Cavaliere Ugo Stella to acquire the assets of the ailing Italian subsidiary of French
        carmaker Darracq, of which he had been an investor and manager.[4] Its first car was the 24 HP, designed by
        Giuseppe Merosi, which became commercially successful and participated in the 1911 Targa Florio endurance race.
        In August 1915, ALFA was acquired by Neapolitan entrepreneur and engineer Nicola Romeo, who vastly expanded the
        company's portfolio to include heavy machinery and aircraft engines. In 1920, the company's name was changed to
        Alfa Romeo, with the Torpedo 20–30 HP being the first vehicle to bear the new brand.

        Through the 1920s, Alfa Romeo produced several successful road and race cars, and was well represented in
        prominent European motorsport events, notably winning the inaugural Grand Prix in 1925. Nevertheless, the
        company soon faced financial troubles, leading to Romeo's contentious departure in 1928 and Italian government
        ownership in 1933. Under the control of the industrial organization Institute per la Ricostruzione Industriale
        (IRI), Alfa Romeo initially continued making its signature custom luxury vehicles, but following the financial
        hardship of World War II, shifted to mass-producing small vehicles. In 1954, it launched the Giulietta series of
        family cars and developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1994.

        Alfa Romeo became known for producing mass-market vehicles that nonetheless blended the aesthetics and
        performance of sport and luxury marques. Despite its strong brand image and relatively sizeable share of the
        high-performance auto market in Europe, by the 1970s, the company was operating at a loss, prompting IRI to sell
        it to Fiat Group in 1986.[5] Alfa Romeo has since maintained its distinct identity and brand through several
        ownership changes, including Fiat's merger with the American Chrysler Group in 2014, forming Fiat Chrysler
        Automobiles (FCA), and FCA's subsequent merger in 2021 with the French PSA Group to form Stellantis.

        Alfa Romeo is heavily involved in various motorsports—including Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar
        racing, touring car racing, and rallies—with achievements giving a sporty image to the marque. Enzo Ferrari
        founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before forming his namesake
        luxury sports car maker in 1939. Ferrari has had the most wins of any marque in the world.[6]</p>
