        <h2>Causes of the War</h2>
        <p>The First World War, also known as World War I, began on July 28, 1914, after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. However, this event was only the spark that ignited the war, as underlying causes had been brewing for decades.</p>
        <p>Several factors contributed to the outbreak of World War I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nationalism:</strong> Many countries in Europe were driven by a sense of nationalism, leading to tensions and competition for power.</li>
            <li><strong>Militarism:</strong> European nations were building up large military forces, making war seem like a viable solution to disputes.</li>
            <li><strong>Imperialism:</strong> European powers were competing for colonies and influence around the world, leading to conflicts of interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliance System:</strong> The complex system of alliances between European nations meant that if one country was attacked, others were bound to get involved. For example, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, which then involved Russia, Germany, France, and Great Britain.</li>
            <li><strong>The Assassination of Franz Ferdinand:</strong> The immediate cause of the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist. This event sparked a series of diplomatic maneuvers and alliances that eventually led to the war.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Countries and Their Goals</h2>
        <p>The First World War was fought between two main groups: the Allies and the Central Powers. Below are the key countries involved in the conflict and their motivations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Germany was part of the Central Powers and aimed to expand its empire and assert dominance in Europe. They supported Austria-Hungary after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and declared war on Russia, France, and Belgium.</li>
            <li><strong>Austria-Hungary:</strong> Austria-Hungary was one of the Central Powers, and after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, they sought to punish Serbia for its role in the plot. They also hoped to maintain their control over the Balkans, where nationalist movements were gaining strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Great Britain:</strong> Great Britain joined the war due to its alliance with France and Belgium. Germany's invasion of Belgium was a direct violation of international law, and Britain declared war on Germany in defense of Belgium's neutrality. Additionally, Britain sought to protect its empire and maintain balance of power in Europe.</li>
            <li><strong>France:</strong> France was a member of the Allies and had long-standing rivalries with Germany. France wanted to regain territories lost in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, particularly the region of Alsace-Lorraine. They also wanted to prevent Germany from dominating Europe.</li>
            <li><strong>Russia:</strong> Russia supported Serbia due to shared Slavic ties and was concerned about Austria-Hungary's growing influence in the Balkans. Russia also feared German expansion and sought to protect its own borders from German aggression.</li>
            <li><strong>Italy:</strong> Initially part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy switched sides in 1915 to join the Allies, hoping to gain territory in the Alps and Dalmatian coast after the war.</li>
            <li><strong>United States:</strong> The United States initially remained neutral but entered the war in 1917 after German unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram, which proposed a German-Mexican alliance. The U.S. aimed to protect its economic interests and support the Allies in defeating the Central Powers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Franz Ferdinand</h2>
        <p>Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. He was born in 1863 and was known for his conservative views and desire to reform the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His assassination by Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo in 1914 became the direct trigger for the war.</p>
        <p>Franz Ferdinand was deeply involved in the politics of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was struggling with internal ethnic tensions. He had plans to grant more autonomy to the empire's Slavic populations, but this was opposed by many of the ruling elites. His assassination created a chain reaction that led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, and soon, other nations became involved, resulting in the outbreak of World War I.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>World War I was one of the most devastating conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 16 million deaths and altering the political and social landscape of Europe. The war led to the downfall of empires such as the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, and German Empires, and it laid the groundwork for the rise of World War II.</p>
        <p>After the war, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, officially ending the war and imposing heavy penalties on Germany. However, the harsh terms of the treaty contributed to economic instability in Germany and the rise of Adolf Hitler, ultimately leading to the outbreak of World War II.</p>
